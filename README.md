# 3-D Printed BioSemi EEG Hat Electrodes Clip

Have you ever found yourself in the situation where you had to set up 64 or more electrodes on a BioSemi device all by yourself? Or have you had to conduct a pilot EEG experiment on yourself before recruiting participants? This process can be quite time-consuming, taking anywhere from half an hour to an hour or even more before the experiment can begin. Imagine how much more efficient the process could be if the setup time could be halved.

To address this issue, I have developed a small, 3D-printed device that clips all electrodes onto the BioSemi EEG hat prior to placing it onto the participants. You can see an example of it in action in the attached images.

When preparing for an experiment, simply inject gel into all holes and the electrodes will be ready for placement, allowing for a faster setup. With this add-on, the setup time for a 64-channel hat could be reduced to as little as 10 minutes, even with only one person performing the setup.

> **Note**
> While this solution may significantly reduce your setup time for the participants, it did come with a cost. It requires a longer preparation time before your participants arrive, as well as a longer cleanup time after the experiment is completed.
